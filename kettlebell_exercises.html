            <b>Kettlebell Press</b>
            Standing with feet roughly shoulder width apart, squat down and grab the kettlebell. Keeping your back
            straight, return to a standing position. Lift kettlebell to shoulder position, tucking elbow into side as
            you do. From this starting position, extend your arm, pressing the kettlebell overhead, then return to the
            starting position. Make sure to keep correct posture throughout, tightening your core and keeping your back
            straight.

            <b>Kettlebell Lunge</b>
            Standing with feet roughly hip distance apart, squat down and grab the kettlebell. Keeping your back
            straight and core tight, return to a standing position. Lift kettlebell with both handand hold in front of
            chest, this is the starting position. Step forward with one leg and lower into a near 90 degree lunge
            position, making sure to keep a neutrally aligned posture with back straight, core tight and that your knee
            tracks following the lead foot and does not pass your toes. Return to starting position.
